<h1>My Interests and Hobbies</h1>
<ol>
    <li>I very much have enjoyed learning both Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and Muay Thai. Before having learned both of these sports I always thought MMA was a very brutish sport. However now experiencing the dediction that goes into perfecting your technique and gaining knowledge of how to fight smart, i have an all new appreciaton for the sport.</li>
    <li>The art of Gunpla, ot plastic Gundam  models, has been a hobby of mine for years. I absolutely fell in love with it from my first model i built.</li>
    <li>Skateboarding has and always will be my favorite hobby. Although I don't do it as much as I used to, thanks to getting older, I still try to find time every now and then to ride.</li>
